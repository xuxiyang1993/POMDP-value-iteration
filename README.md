# POMDP-value-iteration
A finite horizon value iteration algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), based on the approach for baby crying problem in the book Decision Making Under Uncertainty by Prof Mykel Kochenderfer.

The equations are from the book *Decision Making Under Uncertianty* and *Markov Decision Process in Artificial Intelligence*.
